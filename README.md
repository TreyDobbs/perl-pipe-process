# perl-pipe-process
This program will accept three command-line arguments. The program should verify the number of arguments and the validation of the arguments. If the arguments are valid, the program should create four child processes. After the parent process creates the child processes, it should wait so that the child processes can finish. The child processes should send the sum of its generated numbers to the parent using a pipe. The parent should compute the global mean of all the data (rounded to the nearest hundredth) and send that mean back to each of the four child processes using the pipe. Each child process will display a single line (shown at bottom of report) summarizing its statistics. The parent process should generate a report heading (to the screen).
